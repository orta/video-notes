Over the weekend I changed the layout of my office, to give a more interesting background. Set up a portable philips hue for background ambient lighting. Tried using [Cascable](https://cascable.se) for webcam support.

Recording for the day: https://youtu.be/-hIB-hbzAiM

I used Screenflow, and spent a lot of hours looking into the getting the audio quality good:

In the end it is 6 out of 10. Reasonable enough, but the room echoes and I need to buy some sound proofing tiles for the room I think. They seem cheap enough.

I grabbed the trial for Final Cut Pro X, will maybe try record with that tomorrow
I upgraded from Screenflow 6 to Screenflow 9 - mainly because I want to make sure virtual webcams work, and their editing tools allow for 0-length cuts now, so no awkward animations

### To look at tomorrow: 
 - I got the remix kits for my old band Kierononon for background music, unsure if I need it given how fast I talk though. 
 - Need to look into ways to keep access to some information on screen but to not have my eyes flicker up to it
 - Try soundproof the room in some way
