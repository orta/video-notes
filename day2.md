I created "why make signal" with an attempt to get to grips with a lot more of the editing process, this video was
basically recorded in as close to one take as possible. 

There's a few edits, and they feel very harsh. Lighting and sound just aren't quite there. I have some ideas to explore there tomorrow:

 - Lighting: 
    Higher input quality: don't record via cascable, use the native video editing - I don't get the ability to do it via the mouse but I'd be surpised if this wasn't a boost in visuals.
    
    Need a strongler lighting direction

  
 - Audio: there's a lot of tinny echo, my room is a blank white box and while there is a lot of stuff up - I face a blank wall basically
